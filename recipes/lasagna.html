    <h3>Italian Sausage and Mushroom Lasagna with Bechamel Sauce</h3>
    <p>
      The bechamel adds a little something special to this wonderful lasagna. I
      like to use part skim ricotta and mozzarella and low-fat milk to cut some
      of the fat in this dish. You won't notice the difference.
    </p>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>1 serving cooking spray</li>
      <li>1/2 pound bulk mild italian sausage</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 cups low-fat milk</li>
      <li>1 package no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>2(24 ounce) jars of marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees</li>
      <li>
        Place the sausage in a skillet over medium heat and cook until browned
        and crumbly, about 10 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        To make bechamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat
        and whisk in the flour. Allow the flour and butter to cook until light
        and foamy, about 2 mintues.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, beat the egg and stir in the ricotta cheese and parsley until
        thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble lasagna, pour about 1 1/2 cup of marinara sauce into the
        bottom of the prepared baking dish and top the sauce with 4 lasagna
        noodles, overlapping if necessary. On the noodles, layer 1/3 of the
        ricotta mixture, followed by 1/3 of the cooked sausage, 1/3 cup of
        mushrooms, 1/4 of the bechamel sauce, 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese,
        1/8 cup of the Parmesan cheese and 1 more cup of marinara sauce. Repeat
        the layers twice more, ending with a final layer of noodles topped with
        a layer of marinara sauce, bechamel sauce, the remaining mozzarella
        cheese, and remaining Parmesan cheese. Cover the dish with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and the noodles are tender,
        about 1 hour. Remove foil and bake until the top cheese layer is
        browned, about 5 more minutes. Allow the lasagna to stand for 10 minutes
        before cutting.
      </li>
    </ol>
