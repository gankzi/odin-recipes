    <h3>
      The best big batch cookie recipe: Award winning soft chocolate chip
      cookies
    </h3>
    <p>
      This recipe made perfectly soft chocolate chip cookies. The dough is made
      with two packets of instant pudding mix — an ingredient I had never seen
      anyone use in cookie dough — which seems to give the cookies a softer,
      more bakery-style texture. Think of these as the "soft-baked" style
      cookies that have a somewhat pliable, bendy texture.
